                    This was the first off-platform project I did for Python. The project was adapted to make it easier or more difficult
                    depending on what the user chose. The computer randomly selects a number and you have 3 guesses to try and guess the 
                    correct number. The computer also gave hints to your guess if you were close or not with your guess.

                <p>
                    The Orion Constellation was a off-platform project I did in the Python data visualization course. The objective was to create
                    a scatter plot which given co-ordinates in 2D and 3D. As a added feature I added the names of the stars that the
                    co-ordinates represented.

                <p>
                    The Scrabble game was my first attempt in creating a game from scratch. The single player game randomly selects a letter
                    that your must start with. The word that you make is then scored according to the scrabble scoring system. If your word
                    didn't start with the letter selected then it was not scored and a turn was added to turn counter. You have to try to get
                    to 150 points as fast as possible using as little amount of turns as possible. Each word entered is also checked against
                    the Scrabble Dictionary to validate the word used. At the end the score was added to scoreboard.
